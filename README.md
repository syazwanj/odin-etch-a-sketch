# Odin Etch-A-Sketch
Made as a project as part of The Odin Project. This project features 4 different modes:

1. Colour Mode (default)
   - Allows you to colour in the grid based off the colour of the colour selector.
2. RGB Mode
   - Randomly picks a colour for you.
3. Darken Mode:
   - Darkens a square by 10% every time.
4. Lighten Mode:
   - Lights a square by 10% every time.

It's not 100% perfect but it's good enough! Something to be explored in the future would be to set the size of the game per the window size. Currently it overflows in most users' windows.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla Javascript
- Visual Studio Code
- Git & Github (borrowed some parts from others!)

## Other explored concepts
